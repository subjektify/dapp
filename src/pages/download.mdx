<button class="button button--primary margin-bottom--md">Open in VSCode</button>

<h2>via <code>npm</code></h2>
<p>For those who prefer working with the command line, Subjektify provides a robust CLI tool. You can install it globally via npm to facilitate the building and deploying of decentralized applications right from your terminal.</p>

<h4>Subjektify in your project</h4>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install subjektify
```

<h4>Installing Subjektify globally</h4>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -g subjektify
```

:::note

Globally installing Subjektify can often be useful to test one-off ideas. However, codebases should prefer a project-wide installation over a global install so that they can benefit from consistent, reproducible builds across different machines.

:::

<h2>via Homebrew</h2>
<p>If you're a macOS user and prefer Homebrew for package management, Subjektify is available as a Homebrew tap. Install it with a simple command to get started on your decentralized application development journey.</p>

```bash
brew install subjektify
```
