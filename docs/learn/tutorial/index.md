# Tutorial

Welcome to the Subjektify tutorials. These guides will help you quickly get up to speed with building decentralized applications (dApps) using Subjektify. Each tutorial focuses on a specific aspect of the development process, from setting up your environment to deploying your first dApp.

## Use Case: Personal Tree

Our goal is to create a virtual tree that users can interact with. The tree will have states (e.g. dimensions, growth stages), behaviors (e.g. planting, watering), and a lifecycle.
