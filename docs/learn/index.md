# Learn Subjektify

Welcome to the Subjektify learning guide! This is your starting point for understanding how to utilize Subjektify to build robust and scalable decentralized applications (dApps). Whether you are a seasoned developer or new to the world of blockchain, this guide will provide you with the essential knowledge and tools to get started quickly.

## What is Subjektify?

Subjektify is a flexible toolkit designed to simplify the development of decentralized applications. It utilizes a subject-oriented programming approach, making it easier to define and manage the data structures, states, and behaviors across your applications.

## Fast Track ⏱️ {#fast-track}

Get started with Subjektify in just a few minutes by following our fast track guide:

1. Install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
