# Learn Subjektify

Welcome to the Subjektify learning guide! This is your starting point for understanding how to utilize Subjektify to build robust and scalable decentralized applications (dApps). Whether you are a seasoned developer or new to the world of blockchain, this guide will provide you with the essential knowledge and tools to get started quickly.

## What is Subjektify?

Subjektify is a flexible toolkit designed to simplify the development of decentralized applications. It utilizes a subject-oriented programming approach, making it easier to define and manage the data structures, states, and behaviors across your applications.

## Fast Track ⏱️ {#fast-track}

Get started with Subjektify in just a few minutes by following our fast track guide:

1. Install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Add Subjektify to your project:

   ```bash
   npx subjektify init
   ```

3. Navigate into your project directory and build your model:

   ```bash
   npx subjektify build
   ```

4. Automatically generate the target languages from your Subjekt definitions.
   ```bash
   npx subjektify codegen
   ```

## Why Use Subjektify?

- **Streamlined Development**: Simplifies the complex process of dApp development with intuitive tools and frameworks.
- **Modular Architecture**: Offers a flexible and modular architecture that can be tailored to your specific project needs.
- **Comprehensive Tools**: Provides a range of tools for code generation, validation, and compilation, ensuring a seamless development workflow.

## Core Components

### Subjektify CLI

The Subjektify Command-Line Interface (CLI) is an essential tool that helps developers scaffold, develop, and manage their dApp projects. It offers a variety of commands to initialize new projects, generate code from Subjekt definitions, and deploy applications efficiently.

### Subjekt IDL

Subjektify includes a specialized interface definition language (IDL) known as Subjekt. This language is designed to define and manage the data structures, states, and behaviors that constitute a dApp's architecture. Subjekt IDL ensures that dApp components are well-structured and easy to manage.

### Plugins and Blueprints

Enhance and customize Subjektify’s functionality with plugins and blueprints. These tools allow for rapid development and ensure adherence to best practices, making it easier to extend the capabilities of your dApp.

### Subject Universe

Subject Universe is a core component of Subjektify that provides a comprehensive framework for organizing and managing various subjects across your applications. It allows you to define relationships and interactions between different subjects, ensuring a cohesive and well-structured application architecture.
