# FAQ

## Why did you develop Subjektify?

Subjektify stems from the need for a highly flexible and extensible framework tailored for decentralized application development. Our experience in the Web3 ecosystem revealed a lack of tools that could cater to the varying needs of developers without imposing rigid structures. Subjektify aims to fill this gap by offering a robust platform that prioritizes developer freedom and creativity.

## Is Subjektify only for Grams?

No, Subjektify is designed to be blockchain-agnostic. Although it integrates seamlessly with the Grams ecosystem, it can be adapted for use with any blockchain or decentralized network.

## Why not use existing frameworks or IDLs?

While there are several frameworks and IDLs available for decentralized development, none offered the level of flexibility and extensibility that we envisioned for Subjektify. We wanted a solution that could adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized technology, rather than confining developers to a fixed set of capabilities.

## What sets Subjektify apart from other frameworks and IDLs?

Subjektify is built with a focus on user-defined structures, known as "subjekts," which allow for customizable and reusable components. It also prioritizes:
- **Code Generation**: Designed for multi-language support through automated code generation.
- **Extensibility**: Incorporates a trait-based system for extending core functionalities.
- **Flexibility**: Protocol-agnostic design allows for easy adaptation to different blockchains or networks.

## What does "protocol-agnostic" mean?

Being protocol-agnostic means that Subjektify does not enforce a specific blockchain or networking protocol. It provides the scaffolding for building decentralized applications, leaving the choice of underlying technology to the developer.

## Will Subjektify Support Plugins for OpenAPI and gRPC?

We are actively exploring the possibility of adding plugin support for OpenAPI and gRPC, given their widespread adoption and the benefits of interoperability.
