<p>Subjektify is a comprehensive ecosystem that leverages a subject-oriented programming approach to simplify the creation and management of dApps. Our platform includes a powerful interface definition language (IDL) called Subjekt, which helps define and manage the data structures, states, and behaviors that make up a dApp's architecture.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Subjektify CLI</strong>: Our command-line tool aids developers in scaffolding, developing, and managing their dApp projects with ease.</li>
<li><strong>Subjekt IDL</strong>: This interface definition language structures and defines the components of a decentralized application, making development more intuitive and organized.</li>
<li><strong>Plugins and Blueprints</strong>: These tools and templates provide additional functionalities and predefined architectures to speed up development and ensure best practices.</li>
