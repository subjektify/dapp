            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the official blog of Subjektify! We're excited to introduce our suite of tools designed to make decentralized application (dApp) development easier and more efficient. Whether you're an experienced blockchain developer or just starting out, Subjektify has something for you.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-subjektify">What is Subjektify?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Subjektify?" title="Direct link to What is Subjektify?" href="https://subjektify.dev/blog/welcome#what-is-subjektify">​</a></h2>
<p>Subjektify is an open-source platform that uses subject-oriented programming (SOP) to create, manage, and deploy dApps. Our platform includes Subjekt, a powerful interface definition language (IDL) that helps you define and manage the data structures, states, and behaviors that make up a dApp.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-components-of-subjektify">Key Components of Subjektify<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Components of Subjektify" title="Direct link to Key Components of Subjektify" href="https://subjektify.dev/blog/welcome#key-components-of-subjektify">​</a></h2>
